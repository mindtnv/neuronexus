# NeuroNexus

Anki reimagined — graph learning, garden gamification, grounded AI chat, and notebook-style source study.

NeuroNexus is a Bun-workspace monorepo with an Elysia/Better Auth/Drizzle API and a Next.js 16/React 19 frontend. The current toolchain baseline is Bun 1.3.14, TypeScript 7.0.2, Node 26 Current for the standalone web image, and PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector 0.8.2.

## Layout

```text
apps/web           # Next.js App Router, client-first UI, port 3001
apps/api           # Elysia HTTP server on Bun, port 3000
packages/db        # Drizzle schema, client, seed, and versioned migrations
packages/auth      # Better Auth configuration shared by API and web
packages/shared    # Pure TypeScript types and FSRS helpers
docker-compose.yml # Local PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector 0.8.2
```

## Requirements

- Bun 1.3.14 (the version pinned by `packageManager`, CI, and Docker)
- Node 26 when running Node-based tooling outside Bun/Docker (`.node-version`)
- Docker with Compose v2
- A root `.env`, initially copied from `.env.example`

AI, email, web-search, and external object-storage credentials are optional. Without AI keys, the indexing/chat surfaces degrade gracefully and the rest of the application remains available.

## First-time setup

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres
bun run db:migrate:apply
```

The local Compose stack initializes both `neuronexus` and `neuronexus_test`. To add demo/reference data, run `bun run db:seed`.

## Development

```bash
bun run dev           # web :3001 + API :3000
bun run dev:web       # Next.js only
bun run dev:api       # Elysia only, with reload
```

Open `http://localhost:3001`; a fresh database redirects to `/auth/sign-up`. Swagger UI is available at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

Next uses local URL fallbacks when `apps/web/.env.local` is absent. If browser-facing values need to come from the root environment during local development, symlink `apps/web/.env.local` to `../../.env` instead of maintaining a second env file.

## Verification

```bash
bun run typecheck     # every workspace
bun run test          # full unit + API integration suite; prepares test DB first
bun run build         # API bundle + Next.js production build
bun audit             # dependency vulnerability audit
```

There is currently no separate linter. Pull requests require typecheck, the full test suite, and clean production builds.

## Database commands

```bash
bun run db:push                # destructive schema sync for disposable dev data
bun run db:push:test           # same against TEST_DATABASE_URL
bun run db:generate            # generate the next versioned SQL migration
bun run db:migrate:apply       # apply the committed migration chain
bun run db:migrate:apply:test  # apply it against the test database
bun run db:seed                # seed local demo/reference data
bun run db:studio              # open Drizzle Studio
```

Production-bound schema changes use `db:generate`, reviewed/committed SQL, and `db:migrate:apply`. Use `db:push --force` only when the target data is disposable and the change needs no ordered backfill.

## Containers

- `apps/api/Dockerfile` builds and runs on `oven/bun:1.3.14-alpine` and applies pending migrations before API startup.
- `apps/web/Dockerfile` builds with Bun 1.3.14 and runs the Next standalone output on Node 26 Alpine.
- Both Compose files use `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.2-pg18`. PostgreSQL 18 volumes mount at `/var/lib/postgresql`; upgrading from an older major requires `pg_upgrade` or a fresh disposable volume.

See `.env.example` for configuration and `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` for the detailed architecture and repository-working contract.
