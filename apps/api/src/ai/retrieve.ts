// Vector retrieval over kb_chunk (Slice 4, plan §187-208).
//
// `retrieve()` runs a pgvector cosine top-k (`<=>`) against the GLOBAL HNSW
// index and joins each hit back to its card provenance (cardId, deckId, a
// render_text snippet). No reranker — the ANN ordering is the result order.
//
// CRITICAL (SHOULD-FIX #11): the HNSW index is GLOBAL across all users. The
// `WHERE kb_chunk.user_id = $userId` predicate is the SOLE cross-tenant
// boundary, so `userId` is REQUIRED (not optional) and the predicate is ALWAYS
// present in the generated SQL. Optional deck/tag filters are applied as
// additional pre-filter predicates alongside the `<=>` ordering.
