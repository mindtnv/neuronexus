// Notebook source recommendations (Р11): given a notebook's attached sources,
// suggest other library sources that are semantically near the notebook's
// "centroid" — the average of a sample of its document vectors.
//
// Works from STORED vectors alone (no live embedder), like semantic-edges /
// concept-map. Two conceptual steps, ONE SQL statement:
//
//   centroid: AVG(embedding) over a sample of ≤ CENTROID_SAMPLE document vectors
//   of the ATTACHED sources (pgvector ships an `avg(vector)` aggregate). The
//   sample is bounded so a huge notebook doesn't average thousands of rows.
//
//   probe: an ANN top-k over DOCUMENT vectors NOT belonging to the attached
//   sources, JOINed to `sources` with `status='ready'` + `user_id` (so a
//   mid-ingest / foreign / non-ready source is never recommended). GROUP BY
//   source_id, MAX(score), top SUGGEST_LIMIT.
//
// EVERY probe conjunct that touches kb_chunk carries the document-guard trio
// (kc.user_id, kc.source_type='document') — the global HNSW index mixes card +
// document vectors; without the guard the centroid would drag in card vectors
// (§0 invariant). No attached vectors / nothing unattached ⇒ honest degrade.
